            <h4>ABOUT FUGUE</h4>
            
            <p>Begun in 1990 at the University of Idaho, Fugue has continuously published poetry, plays, fiction, essays, visual-text hybrids, and interviews from established and emerging writers biannually. We take pride in the work we print, writers we publish, and the presentation of each and every issue. Working in collaboration with local and national artists, our covers display some of the finest art from photography and digital art to ink drawings and oil paintings. We believe that each issue is a print and digital artifact of a deep engagement with our culture, and we make it our personal goal that the writing we select and presentation of each issue reflect the reverence we have for art and letters.</p>

            <p>Fugue is managed and edited by graduate students in the English and Creative Writing Programs at University of Idaho in Northern Idaho, one of the nation's most beautiful regions covered with wilderness areas, mountains, rivers, and lakes.</p>
            
            <h4>THE CONTEST</h4>
                
            <p>Every year, Fugue hosts our Annual Writing Contest, publishing winners in both prose and poetry and awarding them $1,000 each. Past judges include Pam Houston, Dorianne Laux, Rodney Jones, Mark Doty, Rick Moody, Ellen Bryant Voigt, Jo Ann Beard, Rebecca McClanahan, Patricia Hampl, Traci Brimhall, Edan Lepucki, and Tony Hoagland.</p>
                
            <p>We are excited to announce that this year's contest judges are Chen Chen (poetry) and Aisha Sabatini Sloan (prose). Submission period Feb 1-April 15, 2019. Go here to submit.</p>
                    
            <h4>DIGITAL PRESENCE</h4>

            <p>Like many journals and magazines in recent years, Fugue has entered the world of digital print. While our Summer/Fall issues are still printed hard copy and distributed to contributors and subscribers, we now publish Winter/Spring issues digitally. Digital publication allows us to host our digital content here, on our website, completely free to the public.</p>
                
            <p>Additionally, we host a digital archive of all back issues for free. This archive, managed by the Digital Initiatives Department in the University of Idaho Library, provides Fugue's readers access to over two decades of content.</p>
                
            <h4>PAST CONTRIBUTORS</h4>
